Anomaly_Detection

I have taken one of the data sets from https://github.com/numenta/NAB/tree/master/data

Things that I have done:

1. Visualization
2. Extracting new features from the given features
3. Anamoly detection using isolation forest
      contamination 0.05
      contamination 0.1
      Fitting all the features into 3 dimensions using PCA
      Fitting all the features into 2 dimensions using PCA
      Detecting outliers
4. Anamoly detection using svm model
